  <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>

  <p class="is-text-center">

    I have been developing websites since 2011, when I first jump into a Front End Developer Internship in Milan, Italy<br>

    After 2 months of watching tutorials and reading articles I passed from ‘knowing nothing’  to  ‘have some idea’ about web development.<br>

    But that was enough for the guys from <a href="http://www.more.it" target="_blank" title="More Interactive">More Interactive</a> to give me a try :)<br><br>

    Since that I keep learning as much as I can. It’s been 7 years of great opportunities, great people <br>

    and amazing projects from Agencies in Milan to a Startup in London and from Contracts in Thailand to Remotes in Europe.<br><br>

    Have a look on my  <router-link to="/lab" title="LABORATORY">Lab</router-link> page for some coding experiments using Vue.js.<br><br>

    By the way, this website is built with Vue.js and <i>should</i> work offline as well by the power of Service Workers (on supported browser of course).<br><br>

    I love developing websites with Wordpress + Advanced Custom Fields + Timber (Twig for Wordpress). And now with Worpdress REST API + Vue.js

    My main skills are:

    Working as a freelancer is not just about the coding. <br>
    I understand the challenges of working remotely on client projects.<br>
    Here’s a couple of things I think I’m good at:
