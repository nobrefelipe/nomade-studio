  <p class="is-text-center">

    I have been developing websites sice 2011, when I first jump into a Front End Developer Intership in Milan, Italy<br>

    Working as a freelancer is not just about the coding. <br>
    I understand the challenges of working remotely on client projects.<br>
    Here’s a couple of things I think I’m good at:
